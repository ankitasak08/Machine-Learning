# Logistic Regression for predicting university admission.

## Overview

This project involves building a logistic regression model to predict whether a student will get admitted into a university. As the administrator of a university department, the goal is to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their performance in two exams.

## Problem Statement

The specific problem addressed in this project is to predict the admission status of an applicant using historical data from previous applicants. The dataset includes scores from two exams and the corresponding admission decision for each training example. The objective is to develop a logistic regression model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission based on their exam scores.

## Approach

The approach taken involves utilizing logistic regression, a classification algorithm, to build a predictive model. Logistic regression is well-suited for binary classification problems, making it suitable for predicting whether a student will be admitted (1) or not (0) based on exam scores.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of historical data from previous applicants. It includes features such as scores on two exams and the corresponding admission decision (binary outcome).

## Implementation

The logistic regression model is implemented using Python and its NumPy and Matplotlib libraries . The model is trained on the historical data to learn the relationship between exam scores and admission outcomes.

## Usage

To use the model for prediction, input the scores of an applicant's two exams, and the model will provide an estimated probability of admission.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific requirements.
